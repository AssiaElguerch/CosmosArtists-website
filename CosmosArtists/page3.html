        <h1>Why Science & Art ?</h1>
     <div class="img"></div>
       <p>"Scientists are artists as well" , it's a quote said by the most common scientist "Albert Einstein",where he tried to demonstrate that there is a strong relationship between art and science. However ,many people think that science and art are separated. 
        Over the ages,combining between science and art was and still till now a pressing exigency for scientists,and to prove that ,we can take as an example the procedure of coming up with a scientific fact or theory. As we know,once a scientist come up with a new scientific theory,he tries to draw a model of it to represent it , save it ,and make it more clear and understandable by others , and teachers of scientific school subjects as well pursue the same procedure to transfer to their students those sciences and theories. In addition , in computer science field,robotics and software engineers, as well as web developers ,couldn't start building robots, or software before designing and drawing their models .Furthermore, in the space and astronomy field,space agencies couldn't build telescopes and rockets before designing and drawing their models by using the art of Origami ,which demonstrates that art and science are overlapped. 
        In short , art is a very  important part of science , or rather art is the base of science, since if we don't use artwork in different scientific fields, we cannot obtain a good result .
